TODO
there is the problem that when i ask the best action in Q then there is not division between actions of white player and actions of black, then I shuold add a field in both tables R and Q which will record which one has made the move.

Refactor first DatabaseTest, then Database.py then recreate all the new tables in the chessqboard DB and finally check

Interesting statistic should be the comparison of the cumulative reward that both agents (white with qlearning and black with random choices will score) in fact this should be enougth to show the improvement due to learning.

initialize db chessQboard
CREATE TABLE RTABLE (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,STATE  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,ACTION  VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,REWARD INT,TURN VARCHAR(10),EPOQUE INT,ITERATION INT );

CREATE TABLE QTABLE (STATE  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,ACTION  VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,REWARD FLOAT(2),TURN VARCHAR(10),PRIMARY KEY(STATE,ACTION));

CREATE TABLE PTABLE (ITERATION INT NOT NULL,EPOQUE INT NOT NULL, WAVGR FLOAT(2), WAVGQ FLOAT(2), BAVGR FLOAT(2), BAVGQ FLOAT(2), QSIZE INT, PRIMARY KEY(ITERATION, EPOQUE));

INSERT INTO RTABLE (state, action, reward, turn , epoque, iteration) VALUES ("1k1/ppp/111/111/PPP/1K1","K.a2-a1","0","white","0","0");
