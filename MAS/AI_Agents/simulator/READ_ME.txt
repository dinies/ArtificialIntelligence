This package contains a complete simulator for a multi agent system (MAS) in a grid world. 

The simulator was implemented using the Java SE Development Kit 7. It is recommended to update your current version by downloading the latest release from this website:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

All the classes of the simulator belong to the multiagent package and need to be compiled.
The main subroutine is located in WorldPanel.java. If you want to try different initial conditions you can modify the main.

To run the simulator, after you've completed the files, you should follow these three steps:

1) Reach the folder where the package multiagent is contained with the terminal.

2) Compile the file WorldPanel.java by typing: 

javac multiagent/WorldPanel.java (if you're a Unix user)

javac multiagent\WorldPanel.java (if you're a Windows user)

3) Run the code:

java multiagent.WorldPanel

For further information and details regarding the simulator, please refer to the documentation. Just open the doc folder and the index.html that is available in that folder.
